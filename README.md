# Disembarkation Strategies for Commercial Aircraft

## Overview
This project aimed to simulate and evaluate various disembarkation strategies for commercial aircraft using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. The goal was to identify the most efficient strategies for optimizing passenger flow during the disembarkation process, thereby reducing turnaround time and increasing profitability for airline companies.

## Methodology
The research employed ABM simulations to model the disembarkation process for two popular aircraft models: the Boeing 737 and Boeing 777. The simulations incorporated various passenger attributes, such as age, family groups, and luggage handling, to accurately represent real-world scenarios.

## Strategies Evaluated
The following disembarkation strategies were evaluated:

- Random strategy
- Steffen strategy
- WILMA strategy
- Front to back (F2B) strategy
- Back to front (B2F) strategy
- Reversed Pyramid strategy
- Blocks strategy
- Adjusted Steffen strategy
- Adjusted WILMA strategy

## Key Findings
- The random strategy consistently performed remarkably well, surpassing structured strategies in terms of disembarkation time for both the Boeing 737 and Boeing 777 aircraft.
- Demographic group composition (e.g., children, elderly) had minimal impact on disembarkation delays.
- Luggage placement played a crucial role in the efficiency of the disembarkation process, with proper luggage placement significantly reducing delays.
- For the Boeing 737, WILMA and adjusted Steffen strategies showed slightly better performance than the random strategy, but the improvements were minimal.
- For the Boeing 777, the random strategy outperformed all other structured strategies, including the adjusted Steffen strategy.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made:

1. Implement a random disembarkation strategy for commercial aircraft, as it consistently performed well across different scenarios.
2. Optimize luggage placement during the boarding process to minimize delays during disembarkation.
3. Seat family groups together to reduce congestion in the aisle during the disembarkation process.

## Future Work
Future research could explore additional factors and strategies to further enhance the efficiency of the disembarkation process, taking into account the specific operational constraints and objectives of airline companies.
